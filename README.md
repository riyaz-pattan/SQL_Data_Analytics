This project showcases a comprehensive sales analysis for **Ferns N Petals (FNP)**, an online gifting platform. It uses SQL and Python for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, with insights presented through an interactive dashboard.

## 🎯 **Key Features**
1. **Data Cleaning and Manipulation**:
   - Python (`pandas`) was used to clean and preprocess the sales data.
   - Addressed missing values, renamed columns for consistency, and derived metrics like `profit` and `sale price`.
   - Converted date columns to proper `datetime` formats and performed column drops to optimize storage.

2. **SQL Queries for Analysis**:
   - Explored critical business questions such as:
     - Top 10 revenue-generating products.
     - Month-over-month sales comparison for 2022 vs. 2023.
     - Categories and subcategories with the highest growth in profit.
   - Leveraged SQL for complex aggregations and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

3. **Visualization**:
   - Built an interactive Power BI dashboard displaying insights like:
     - Revenue by occasion, category, and hour.
     - Top-selling products and cities.
     - Month-over-month revenue trends.
   - Dashboard highlights key KPIs: total orders, total revenue, average delivery time, and average customer spending.
